# UFO Sightings
## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to build a website that lists all UFO sightings in the last 10 years. Furthermore, we created a search that enabled us to further filter the data to help the user find exactly what they are looking for. 

## Results

The user can now navigate to the page and search by the follow criteria:
- date
- city
- state
- country
- shape

Once they type in the selected criteria that they are looking for, we have written javascript code to filter the list accordingly. 

For example:

![filter table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104734224/185467270-8be1c5f4-f2c8-4827-9ba2-d97e92d8f738.png)

Here we searched by California and got filtered results.

## Summary

In summary:
 - one drawback to this design is that the table is formatted in an awkward way so if given the resources, we would find a better way to format the table.
 - two recommendations:
    - Add more filters to the search criteria to further customize the search feature
    - Add more data to further add more content to this list.
